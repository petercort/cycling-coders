Welcome to Pete's corner of the cycling coders. 

My projects are as follows: 

1. Try and establish if there is any coorelation between the time of day and your physiological performance. Aka, vo2 max intervals suck when I do them first thing, is there a better time to do them? 

2. Which cadence is optimal for me! Looking at things like HR drift over time at specific cadences and power zones.
