Welcome to Pete's corner of the cycling coders. 

My projects are as follows: 

1. Try and establish if there is any coorelation between the time of day and your physiological performance. Aka, vo2 max intervals suck when I do them first thing, is there a better time to do them? 

2. Which cadence is optimal for me! Looking at things like HR drift over time at specific cadences and power zones. 




I'm also going to try and set this up to be usable by anybody and everyone who wants to play with it. 

1. Install Python 3

2. Install the python dependencies, command may differ based on your OS, IDE, Installation preference etc... but basically something like this
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start the server 
  python3 manage.py runserver

4. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/GraphMyRide/ in your browser and view my lovely graph of Pettit! 

Now you're all setup for local dev work. Have fun!
